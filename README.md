This is my repository for my 3rd visualization essay for Clio II.

This repository contains the code used to create my third visualization essay for Clio II. This essay explores the practicality of using topic modeling to explore the [Wright American Fiction collection](http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/TEIgeneral/welcome.do?brand=wright).
